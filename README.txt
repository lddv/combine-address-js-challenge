In this directory you'll find a minimal HTML page, including a stylesheet and
an empty JavaScript file. The page contains a group of input fields that a user
might enter their address into, as well as a larger, empty text-area.

When the "Combine" button is clicked, please use JavaScript to join all of the
individual address fields into a single string. Then insert that string into
the text-area. Use the following format:

    123 Fake Way, Suite 404
    Boston, MA 012345

This is a JavaScript exercise, so you should make as few changes to the markup
as possible. jQuery is included for convenience, however you are not required
to use it.
